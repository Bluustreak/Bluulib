This is a library for various geometry functions and physics functions, somewhat focused on making Nbody simulations.

The modules DrawingPygame and DrawingPyplot will be separated into their own modules later, to be able to use the Bluulib as a pure math,geometry and physics module later, with few if any dependencies
